Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a field within natural language processing that focuses on understanding the sentiment or opinion expressed in textual data. In this report, we explore two distinct methods for analyzing sentiment in Amazon reviews: the traditional VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) with a Bag of Words approach and a more advanced approach using a pretrained RoBERTa model from Hugging Face.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis is the initial step to understand the structure and distribution of the dataset. For Amazon reviews, we conduct EDA by visualizing the distribution of star ratings. This helps us identify patterns and trends in the data before moving on to sentiment analysis.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK
Before applying sentiment analysis techniques, we utilize the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text preprocessing. NLTK provides tools for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. Tokenization breaks text into meaningful units, part-of-speech tagging identifies grammatical elements, and named entity recognition identifies entities within the text.

3. VADER Sentiment Analysis
VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool. It uses a "bag of words" approach, assigning sentiment scores to individual words and combining them to derive an overall sentiment. The three main scores provided by VADER are compound, positive, and negative. We visualize these scores using bar plots to understand sentiment distribution across different star ratings.

4. RoBERTa Pretrained Model
RoBERTa, a transformer-based language model, represents an advanced approach to sentiment analysis. It excels in capturing contextual information and relationships between words, offering a nuanced understanding of sentiment. The model is pretrained on extensive data, allowing it to generalize well to sentiment classification tasks. We apply the RoBERTa model to obtain sentiment scores for comparison.

5. Conclusion
Sentiment analysis is a crucial tool for extracting insights from textual data, especially in the context of customer reviews on platforms like Amazon. Traditional methods like VADER offer simplicity and interpretability, while advanced models like RoBERTa provide state-of-the-art performance. Combining these approaches allows for a comprehensive understanding of sentiment within Amazon reviews.

In summary, this report highlights the iterative process of sentiment analysis, starting with exploratory data analysis and leveraging natural language processing techniques. The inclusion of both traditional and advanced methods showcases the versatility of sentiment analysis in extracting valuable information from diverse datasets. Theoretical understanding and practical application of sentiment analysis contribute significantly to informed decision-making for businesses and organizations.
